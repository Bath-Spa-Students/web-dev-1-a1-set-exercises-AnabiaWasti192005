<p>Fortnite is an online video game and game platform developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. 
It is available in six distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite Battle Royale,
a free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; Fortnite: Save the World, 
a cooperative hybrid tower defense-shooter and survival game in which up to four players fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with 
traps and fortifications they can build; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas,
 Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing and Fortnite Festival.</p>

 <p>Epic was able to prepare to release Fortnite as a paid early access title in July 2017, with plans to release it as free-to-play sometime in 2019
 while gaining feedback from players to improve the game. With the release of Fortnite Battle Royale, the player-versus-environment mode was distinguished
 as "Save the World". Ultimately, Epic opted to release Save the World as a premium title, bringing it out of early access on June 29, 2020.</p>

 <p>Fortnite is rated "T for Teen" by the Entertainment Software Ratings Board, the video game industry equivalent to the Motion Picture Association of America. 
    That falls below Mature (17+) and Adults Only (18+).</p>

<p>Fortnite Battle Royale became a significant financial success for Epic Games, leading them to separate the teams between Save the World and Battle Royale to provide better support for both modes
 Within two weeks of release, over 10 million players had played the mode,[31] and by June 2018, just after the Nintendo Switch release, had reached 125 million players.[32] Revenue from Fortnite Battle Royale during the
 first half of 2018 had been estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars per month, with total 2018 revenue estimated at $2.4 billion by analysis firm SuperData Research.Total revenue for Fortnite reached more than $9 billion by the end of 2019.</p></div>
