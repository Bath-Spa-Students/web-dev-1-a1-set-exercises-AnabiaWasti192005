<h2 align="center"  style="color:#3C3B3B"> <i>A classic, easy spaghetti and meatballs dinner needs garlic bread for dipping so I went on a quest that 
 involved several loaves of bread, chopped garlic, real butter and herbs. Ever wonder how to make garlic bread? This homemade garlic bread is the answer! 
 Minced fresh garlic is key to these flavor-packed crusty slices, which our big family would snap up before they even had a chance to cool.!</i></h2>

 
 <h3 align="center" style="color:#006633"><big><ins><b>INGREDIENTS:</b></ins></big></h3>
 <h3 align="center"  style="color:#6B3B11">1. 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter.</h3>
 <h3 align="center"  style="color:#6B3B11">2. 4 cloves garlic, fine ly chopped.</h3>
 <h3 align="center"  style="color:#6B3B11">3. 1 large soft Italian or French loaf.</h3>
 <h3 align="center"  style="color:#6B3B11">4. 1/4 cup grated Parmesan.</h3>
 <h3 align="center"  style="color:#6B3B11">5. Kosher salt.</h3>
 <h3 align="center"  style="color:#6B3B11">6. 2 tablespoons flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely chopped.</h3>

<h3 align="center" style="color:#666600"> <big><ins><b> DIRECTIONS:</b></ins></big></h3>
<h3 align="center"  style="color:#000033"> 1. Arrange a rack in the center of oven and preheat to 450 degrees F.</h3>
<h3 align="center"  style="color:#000033"> 2. Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, till the butter is golden and the garlic is very fragrant, about 3 minutes.</h3>>
<h3 align="center"  style="color:#000033"> 3. Slice the bread in half lengthwise. Liberally brush the crust with the garlic butter. Turn the bread cut-side up. Slice each loaf crosswise at 2-inch intervals without cutting all the way through, making "pull-apart" garlic bread.</h3>
<h3 align="center"  style="color:#000033"> 4. Liberally brush the cut sides of the bread with more garlic butter, spreading any remaining garlic evenly over top. You should use all the garlic butter. Carefully transfer the bread to a rimmed baking sheet.</h3>
<h3 align="center"  style="color:#000033"> 5. Sprinkle the loaves with the Parmesan and a pinch of salt and bake until the edges of the bread are a deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Top with the parsley. Serve warm. </h3>
